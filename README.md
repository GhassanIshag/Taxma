The CSS classes are defined in the `style.css` file and are applied to the respective HTML elements and pages to achieve the desired styling and layout.

- `.home-call-to-action`:
  
  - This class is applied to the container of the call-to-action section on the home page.
  - Flexbox properties are used to center the content both horizontally and vertically within the container.
  - Media queries are used to modify the background image and add a semi-transparent overlay on smaller screens for better readability.

- `.service-box`:
  
  - This class is applied to the service boxes on the services page.
  - Flexbox properties are used to vertically center the content within each box and create a visually pleasing layout.
